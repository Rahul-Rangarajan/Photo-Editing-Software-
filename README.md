# Photo Editing Software #

This project is an extension of a previous project that is now functioning as a capstone submission for contributors 
Rahul Rangarajan and Jack Castiglione. This program uses a tkinter based GUI and the pillow imaging library, which
is an open-source version of PIL (Python Imaging Library) to allow users to open, customize, and save images using 
a specific set of tools provided to the user through programmed image altering methods. The software supports a 
variety of image formats, including (but not limited to) PNG and JPEG.
